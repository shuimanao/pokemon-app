# Pokemon app

Welcome to my very basic Pokemon app! I built it with React, Typescript and [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2).

## **Scripts which you can use:**

```bash

npm run build

```

Compiles your package with TypeScript Compiler to JavaScript (ES6).

---

```bash

npm start

```

Compiles your package and starts development server that provides live reloading (thanks to webpack-dev-server).

---

```bash

npm run test

```

Runs unit tests for the project. Output with coverage report will be available in the console.
